 **IDThon
Terms and Conditions
Last Updated: June 30, 2023**

These IDthon terms and conditions (the “IDThon Terms”) apply to that certain event known as the IDThon (the “IDThon”) sponsored by ZKID Labs AG (“ZKID Labs”). Please read these IDThon Terms carefully before you participate in the IDThon. The IDThon may have additional terms and conditions or rules (the “Rules”) that may be provided to you with the IDThon’s details. By participating in the IDThon, you represent and agree to be bound by these IDThon Terms and the Rules. The IDThon constitutes Services (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://polygon.technology/polygon-id/terms-and-conditions) (the “Terms of Use”)). In order to participate in the IDThon, you also must agree to the [Terms of Use](https://polygon.technology/polygon-id/terms-and-conditions). In the event of a conflict between the Terms of Use and these IDThon Terms, these IDThon Terms will prevail. ZKID Labs may make changes to these IDThon Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email or updating the date at the top of these IDThon Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended IDThon Terms will be effective immediately.

You will not be able to receive any awards or  prizes associated with this IDThon unless you successfully complete ZKID Labs’ KYC requirements in full within 30 days of being contacted by ZKID Labs at the contact email address you provided when registering for the IDThon.

Further, ZKID Labs reserves the right to limit or refuse your eligibility to participate in the IDThon for any reason in its sole discretion, including where your participation is prohibited by any domestic or foreign law, rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order, protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement, or guideline, published or in force that applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, common law or equity (collectively,“Applicable Laws”). If ZKID Labs becomes aware of any violation of these IDThon Terms, the Rules and/or the [Terms of Use](https://polygon.technology/polygon-id/terms-and-conditions), ZKID Labs may elect to, among other things, (i) prohibit you from using the Services; or (ii) withhold, amend, or cancel the benefits and/or awards of the IDThon.

By participating in the IDThon, you represent and warrant that you meet the requirements contained in these IDThon Terms and the Rules. If you do not meet the requirements contained in these IDThon  Terms and the Rules you cannot participate in the IDThon.

2.  **IDThon Details**
    

-   ZKID Labs reserves the right to immediately terminate the participation of any participant who engages in prohibited conduct (as described below).
    
-   At the conclusion of the IDThon, the ZKID Labs will review the performance of each participant. Based on the absolute and relative performance rendered by each participant who completed the IDThon in good standing and without engaging in prohibited conduct, ZKID Labs will determine whether and how what prizes to award to each participant in its sole and absolute discretion as an award for completing the IDThon (each, an “Award”). The Award distributed to each and all participants in this IDThon will be determined by ZKID Labs in its sole discretion, and is subject to change at any time by ZKID Labs. In the event of a dispute between participants in the IDThon about their contributions to a particular project, idea, or proposal, ZKID Labs will have the sole discretion to determine whether each participant's performance satisfies these IDThon Terms and or is deemed sufficient to receive Awards.
    
-   Prizes will be offered as Awards; however, ZKID Labs makes no promises that any participant will receive any minimum or maximum number of Awards. ZKID Labs has no obligation to distribute or pay out all Awards at the conclusion of the IDThon. No participant has a legally binding right to any Award as a result of their participation in the IDThon. ZKID Labs will be relieved of any and all obligations to issue Awards if ZKID Labs, in consultation with legal counsel, determines that such issuances cannot be completed at a commercially reasonable cost without violating applicable laws.
    
-   Participation in the IDThon does not create an employment relationship between the participant and ZKID Labs or any of its affiliates. Nothing contained in these IDThon Terms or the Rules may be construed to create between ZKID Labs or its affiliates and any participant any employment relationship or right to provide services following the conclusion of the IDThon. You understand and agree that you are an independent contractor to ZKID Labs and are not authorized to act as, or represent oneself as, an officer, employee or agent of ZKID Labs for any purpose. No participant has any authority to enter into any agreements or incur any obligations on behalf of ZKID Labs.
    
-   With respect to each participant, ZKID Labs will not withhold any amounts for payment of any taxes unless applicable law requires us to do so. You expressly acknowledge and agree that you have the sole responsibility to pay all taxes, if any, and file all tax returns required by applicable laws, in respect of any amounts provided by ZKID Labs or its affiliates to you due to participation in the IDThon.
